# Climb Tags ðŸ§—

Generator for route information tags at [Sydney Indoor Climbing Gym](http://indoorclimbing.com.au).

The info leaflets currently are very difficult to read from a distance, with poor font legibility and an outdated design. This is an unsolicited attempt to provide a way to produce cleaner and more readable tags.
